# Customer Analytics in Python
Projects for Customer Analytics course at Udemy
## Summary
The courses contains 5 steps to tackle the customer analysis problem.

 1. **Basic Marketing Theory:**  segmentation, targeting, positioning, marketing mix, price elasticity, and neural networks.
 2. Cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction to segment customers. The project employs many packages such as *NumPy, SciPy* and _scikit-learn_ to perform **K-Means algorithms** and **Principal Components Analysis (PCA).**
 3. Explore the data set with conducting **Descriptive Analysis.**
 4. Engage with elasticity modeling for purchase probability, brand choice, and purchase quantity for **Predictive Analysis**. Utilize **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** to model purchase quantity.
 5. Leverage **Deep Learning** model to better predict future customer behaviors.

## Customer Analytics Segmentation

Apply segmentation on customers dataset, starting from raw data and reaching final customer segments.
- Perform K-means clustering with a customer analytics focus;
- Apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on your data to preprocess your features;
- Combine PCA and K-means for even more professional customer segmentation.

## Purchase Analytics 


Explore both the **descriptive and predictive** analysis of the purchase behaviour of customers, including models for purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity.

- Calculate price elasticity of purchase probability;
- Model purchase incidence through probability of purchase elasticity;
- Model brand choice by exploring own-price and cross-price elasticity;
- Complete the purchasing cycle by predicting purchase quantity elasticity

## Deep Learning
Utilize *TensorFlow* package to create deep neural network.

 - Preprocess the data: Balance the data; Split data into training, validation and test datasets; 
 - Train the model, create and optimize the actual network with appropriate hyperparameters; 
  - Save the model for future use, employ the model for prediction.
